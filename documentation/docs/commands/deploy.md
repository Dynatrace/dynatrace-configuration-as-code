# Deploy

The `monaco deploy` command executes the action of deploying configurations to environment(s) defined in a given [deployment manifest](./configuration/configuration.md#deployment-manifest) file.

Usage: `monaco deploy [command options] deployment-manifest`

The most straightforward in using  `monaco deploy` is to run it without any flags (command options) at all and by passing it a file name of your deployment manifest. By doing so, all configurations in the `project` section of the deployment manifest file are applied to all environments stated within the file.

## Example

Consider a [deployment manifest](./configuration/configuration.md#deployment-manifest) file called **deployment-file.yaml** with the given structure below:

```yaml
projects:
  - name: infrastructure
    path: infrastructure

environments:
  - group: development
    entries:
      - name: development
        url: "https://mytenant.live.dynatrace.com"
        token:
          name: "TestIt"
```

The following deploy command will apply the configuration(s) within the **infrastructure** directory to the development environment:

```shell
monaco deploy deployment-file.yaml
```

## Deploy Options

The following options (flags) allow you to change various details about how the deploy command executes and reports on the deploy operation.

- `--project` - Specifies the project(s) to be deployed. This option is used when you want to specify one or more projects to be applied to your environments. `-p` can be used as shorthand option.

- `--environment` - Use this option or `-e` to apply your configuration(s) to specific environments within your deployment manifest file.

- `--continue-on-error` - With this option, deployment is proceeded even if an error is encountered. Use this option to ensure configurations that are valid are applied to your environment(s). The shorthand option is `-c`.

- `--dry-run` - This option or `-d` validates configuration files and skips deployment. It will check whether your Dynatrace configuration files are valid JSON, and whether your tool configuration yaml files can be parsed and used.

## Deploying Multiple Projects

Monaco v1.0 and earlier accepted multiple projects to be deployed, in which case project names seperated by a  comma **","** are passed as a string to the `--project` or `-p` flag.

Monaco v2.0 still supports deploying of multiple projects. The usage of comma **","** seperated projects is deprecated. You will need to pass in multiple `--project` or `-p` flag values instead. These values are your project names to be deployed.

Conside the following deployment manifest with 3 projects.

```yaml
projects:
  - name: infrastructure
    path: infrastructure
  - name: application
    path: application
  - name: alerts
    path: alerts

environments:
  - group: development
    entries:
      - name: development
        url: "https://mytenant.live.dynatrace.com"
        token:
          name: "TestIt"
```

To deploy both the infrastructure and application projects, pass the project names to the `-p` flag as below:
  
```shell
monaco -p infrastructure -p application deploymentfile.yaml
```

Evolved from the Monitoring as Code CLI we provide Observability and Security as Code to fully automate configuration of the Dynatrace platform at any scale- from automating standard configuration of all your Dynatrace environments to meeting specific demands for individual ones.

**The documentation for the Dynatrace Configuration as Code tool Monaco is available [here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/configuration-as-code)**

> Documentation for the previous 1.x versions is still available [here](https://dynatrace.github.io/dynatrace-configuration-as-code/)

You can download the CLI as well as a copy of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from the [release page](https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-configuration-as-code/releases).

## Other forms of Dynatrace Configuration as Code

In addition to our official Configuration as Code tool Monaco there is also a [Dynatrace Terraform provider](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/terraform-provider-dynatrace).

**Please note that unlike Monaco there is no official support provided for the Terraform provider.**

Unless you are already strongly invested in using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code we recommend using Monaco for Dynatrace configuration as code.

# Dynatrace Configuration as Code

Dynatrace Configuration as Code, an evolution from our Monitoring as Code CLI, provides Observability as Code and Security as Code to fully automate configuration of the Dynatrace platform at any scale, 
from automating the standard configuration of all your Dynatrace environments to meeting specific demands for individual environments.

**The documentation for the Dynatrace Configuration as Code tool Monaco is available [here](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/configuration-as-code).**

> Documentation for the previous 1.x versions is still available [here](https://dynatrace.github.io/dynatrace-configuration-as-code/)

You can download the CLI as well as a copy of the Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from the [release page](https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-configuration-as-code/releases).\

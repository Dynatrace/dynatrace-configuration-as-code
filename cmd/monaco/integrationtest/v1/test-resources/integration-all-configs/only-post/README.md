Currently there are some APIs for which updating the config does not work.

These configs are included in the project `only-post` (folder `./test-resources/integration-all-configs/only-post`)

The mobile application API will be fixed in the scope of [#275](https://github.com/dynatrace/dynatrace-configuration-as-code/issues/275)
